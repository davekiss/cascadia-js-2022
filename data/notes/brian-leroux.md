## Abstract

The future is here! We can now model an entire system front to back with pure functions. Come to this talk to learn about applying functional programming concepts to the cloud, and the browser.

## Notes

### Functional programming in web components - Enchance Framework Demo


- dependencies breaking is bad
- Browsers broke stuff all the time back in the day, most browsers are backwards compatible now.
- Build around what will not break in the next 10 years, not what you think will change.
- additive changes help with not breaking things
  - http1 -> http2
  - xml http request -> fetch
  - async/await
  - `<script type="module"></script>`
  - woff -> woff2
  - s3.listobjectsv2
- lots of moving parts
- Can we simplify? Yes! [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
  - Start working with HTML and add JS on top of that.
  - good for accessibility, audience usage and also help with dependencies
- framework are incorporating this

Enhance is a project built in the HTML first, JS and CSS on later manner.
- api routes
- its kind of like php, not a bad thing
- file based routing with plain html
- reuse markup wtih custom elements
- built-in utilities
- uses pure functions to return HTML components

 - Poor Man's Debugger - `JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)`
